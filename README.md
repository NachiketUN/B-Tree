## B-Tree implementation using Python, with zip code finder as an application for DSA course

### B-Tree Insertion, Deletion, Search Algorithms

I have referred to Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen (CLRS) for the algorithms for the operations of the B-Tree

### Prerequisites
Python 
### Files
```
BTree.py
```
Contains implementation of B-Tree Datastructure

```
zip.py   zip2.py
```
Files read the zipcodes of places and store it in the B-Tree , allowing us to search for zipcodes.
## Running the python files

Open the terminal and cd to the directory which contains the downloaded files and enter the following command
```
python filename.py
```
